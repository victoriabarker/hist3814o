# Entry #1 - Headings in Markdown
1) Tried typing #H1 and then my heading, nothing happended
2) Tried adding another space, nothing changed and the heading still did not work
3) Then consulted Sarah Simpkin's getting started with Markdown & noticed that I did not need to write *H1*
4) Instead that is where I wrote the heading
5) Tried that & it worked
