# Entry #1 - Headings in Markdown
## Tried typing #H1 and then my heading, nothing happended
## Tried adding another space, nothing changed and the heading still did not work
## Then consulted Sarah Simpkin's getting started with Markdown & noticed that I did not need to write *H1*
## Instead that is where I wrote the heading
## Tried that & it worked
