July 21st 2017 - Module 2, Exercise 1

In this exercise, I used the Commonwealth War Graves Commission database. I searched my surname (Barker) and then to
refine the search, I specified only those from the First World War serving in the United Kingdom's Navy. 

URL to my search: http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead.aspx

URL to my results : http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead.aspx?cpage=1

I downloaded the results and have saved the file on my laptop.
